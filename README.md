Mesmerizing N-body (kind of) toy simulation. Press s to open settings, z to restart with a new random set, r to change the rendering mode, and c to clear the screen while keeping the current set. Depending of your computer, you may need to reduce the number of bodies in order to have a fluid animation, if too many bodies the animation may be totally stuck.

Interactions between species are random, and some sets are more fun than others. Also, playing with the window size may give some fun results.

## orbit

Solar system orbits from planets point of view. Originally written using canvas 2d rendering, but end up using WebGL since I couldn't figure out how to trace nice long trails otherwise.

_Disclaimer: This is just a toy, not a realistic simulation. In particular, orbits are assumed circular, and all in the same plane. Also, sizes and distances are obvously not to scale, although relative sizes and distances of planets are approximately realistic (but not the ratio distance / size)._
