Javascript fun toys.

## nbody

Mesmerizing N-body toy simulation. Unlike real world particles, this toy simulation allows strange particles pairs, like one repelling onother one which is attracted. This allows much more fun behaviors. Press z to restart, r to change the rendering mode, and c to clear the screen while keeping the current state. Depending of your computer, you may need to tweak the number of bodies. On a relatively old computer, 1000 bodies is fine.
